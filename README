    A filter is defined by:
        
        FIELD OPERATOR VALUE

    FIELD describes a field of the packet and can be one of:
        
        src     The source MAC address of the ethernet packet.
        dst     The destination MAC address of the ethernet packet
        type    The type of the type of the ethernet packet (as defined by IEEE 802).

    OPERATOR describes the comparison to make on the field. It can be one of:

        ==      Equals
        !=      Not equals

    VALUE is an argument to the operator. It must be a either:

        addr    A MAC address literal: 6 pairs of hex digits separated by
                colons, for example de:ad:12:be:ef:34.

        number  A positive integer.
